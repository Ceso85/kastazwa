                            We shared our women</br>				
                            we shared our shores</br>				
                            there was no other way</br>			
                            to reproduce.</br>				

                            Time had no shape</br>			
                            no weight, no mass</br>				
                            sometimes I talk to the clothes you dress.</br>		

                            I talk to the chair</br>				
                            you used to sit-on</br>				
                            because I was never able</br>			
                            to win your soul.</br>				

                            Another fruitless winter</br>
                            the flow of time</br>
                            the worst was gonna happen</br> 
                            we did not know why.</br>

                            Helena came in rhymes</br>
                            Helena came on time</br> 
                            Helena came alone</br>
                            I owe you a child.</br>

                            Before she came we had to pretend</br>
                            before the summer was going to an end</br>
                            pretend to find a way out of the wood</br>
                            pretend to reach Athens as soon as we could.</br>

                            It is a privilege</br> 
                            not to see you more</br>
                            I will no longer bring</br> 
                            the moonlight to your floor.</br>

                            Now I can put a lion</br> 
                            among your delicate angsts</br>
                            now I can set a scandal</br> 
                            on your sex.</br>

                            But then she came</br>
                            and we could not pretend</br>
                            suddenly the summer went to an end</br>
                            pretend to find a way out of the wood</br>
                            pretend to reach Athens as soon as we…</br>

                            And when she came</br> 
                            I could not resist</br>
                            I could not find a way</br>
                            through all the mist.</br>


                            And when she came</br> 
                            I could not resist</br>
                            I could not find a way</br>

                            oh...</br>
                            oh...</br>

                            Wave your way goodbye</br>
                            my shoes are walking away from me</br>
                            And now that my glasses fall over</br>
                            and now that finally I can see.</br>

                            This shot</br>
                            was the greatest one</br>
                            I stole</br>
                            a picture of you</br>
                            while you were</br> 
                            staring into space</br>
                            so much grace.</br>

                            And I know</br>
                            that is hard to keep up</br>
                            with the reality</br>
                            and I know that</br>
                            all of this</br>
                            it is just</br>
                            self defence.</br>

                            You shrug</br> 
                            and I smile</br>
                            you frown</br>
                            and I laugh</br>
                            your distance</br>
                            is a road</br>
                            to run.</br>

                            It is hard</br>
                            to fill up all this space</br>
                            so much grace.</br>

                            I have never been so close</br>
